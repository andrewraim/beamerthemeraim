This is a custom Beamer theme that I use for slides. It was previously named
`beamerthemefoiltex` because it was originally inspired by
[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/foiltex](FoilTeX), but
has been renamed to `beamerthemeraim` because it eventually became a style to
put my preferred customizations. It is intended to be plain so that it not
distracting, leaves as much space as possible for the subject matter, and does
not waste toner when printing handouts. See the included example for usage.
